[x] agent/server STUN hole punching
[x] create bittorrent file from given binary file
[x] http on unix socket so that a user can
    [x] submit a new update
    [x] query overlay's peers (session-table)
[x] gossip protocol over UDP multicast
    [x] send torrent-file from one to another peer
    [x] multicast torrent-file
    [x] re-multicast newer torrent-file
[x] start bittorrent seeding to serve update file
[x] start bittorrent download/seeding when it receives a new update notification
[?] update metadata file must have path of 'metadata/<uuid>-v<version>'
[?] save update metadata when its state changed
[?] delete older version of update
[?] load updates from local database when starting the agent
[ ] allow `admin` command to submit update from any working directory
    [ ] copy the update file to agent's `data/` directory
    [ ] use format `<uuid>-v<version>-<original-filename>` as the new name of update file
    [ ] modify torrent-file to apply above format
[ ] probe available port at NAT router before starting torrent client
    - see https://github.com/anacrolix/torrent/blob/5a7c4fc135eda0996079a46b43bc0ee8116d7093/portfwd.go#L12
    - the port can be picked randomly (between 10000 - 19999)
[ ] implement fallback to TCP when UDP does not work e.g. DCS firewall
